# WGSL Playground

A low-level playground to experiment with **WGSL** (WebGPU Shading Language), built on top of the [robotlabs/gpu-lab](https://github.com/robotlabs/gpu-lab) framework. This project initializes a WebGPU context and provides a simple plane rendering demo, covering the basics of vertex and fragment shaders.
